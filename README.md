# two-sum-solution
Solution to a coding interview question where I needed to locate the pairs of numbers in an integer array whose sum was a specified number.

__Constraints__
- No LINQ
- Make the algorithm as efficient as possible
- Each pair must only appear once, i.e. 1 & 3 is equivalent to 3 & 1.

I believe is solution is O(3n) as the array is iterated 3 times, essentially twice when removing duplicates and once when locating pairs.
